## Overview

T3-Tweet is an educational project, a full-stack Twitter clone built as a portfolio piece. The project is developed using T3-App, a triad of TypeScript, Tailwindcss, and tRPC. The authentication is managed by NextAuth through Discord, and a MySQL database is used for data storage and management. 

This application replicates Twitter's functionality, including features like tweeting, liking posts, following other users, and exploring different user profiles.

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript: A language that builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions.
- Tailwindcss: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
- tRPC: An end-to-end typesafe RPC framework, making it easy to create APIs and libraries with zero boilerplate and robust type safety.
- NextAuth: An easy-to-implement, full-featured authentication library for Next.js projects.
- MySQL: A popular open-source relational database management system.

## Usage
After successful authentication via Discord, users can post tweets, follow other users, like their tweets, and explore user profiles just like on the actual Twitter platform.
